JFlex
============

responsive Joomla! 3.2 template

JoomFlex uses an off canvas navigation pattern, inspired by David Bushell.

JoomFlex is a more liquid version of JoomSkeleton, by integrating Nathan Smiths unsemantic grid system.

JoomSkeleton, JFluid and JFlex are experimental and work in progress.
